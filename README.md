Subject: Leave Request from 19th May to 1st June 2025

Dear [HR's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to request leave from 19th May to 1st June 2025, as I will be attending my sisterâ€™s ring ceremony and handling some important personal responsibilities at home. These events require my full attention and presence with my family during this period.

I understand the importance of my responsibilities at work, and I will ensure that all my current tasks are either completed or properly delegated before I leave. I am also happy to assist with any handovers needed in advance.

I plan to resume work on 2nd June 2025, and I will be available by phone or email during the leave in case of any urgent matters.

Thank you for your support and consideration.

Warm regards, [Your Full Name] [Your Employee ID, if applicable] [Your Department]
